Introduction

**_What is The User Acceptance Testing?_**

User Acceptance Testing is an important phase in the software development lifecycle (equivalent to the automation development lifecycle) since it ensures that the input data 
delivers the intended result. The RPA system mentioned here automates the repetitious activity of completing UAT for web applications, hence reducing time and increasing efficiency.


**_Overview_**

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is an important step in software development. It acts as a 'pass or fail' judgment point before a solution is put into production.
During User Acceptance Testing, testers test the solution's performance by entering data and confirming the results. This has traditionally been a manual procedure, which may be
time-consuming.

The aim of this project is to use RPA to automate User Acceptance Testing for online applications, with a special focus on testing the production of new entries.

**_So What Is The Purpose?_**

1. This RPA project aims to simplify the UAT process for online applications by automating repetitive testing processes.

2. Increase efficiency by reducing human intervention in UAT.

3. Ensure that the supplied data consistently produces the anticipated outcome.

4. Accurate test findings can help to speed up decision-making processes.
