Introduction
This README offers a description of a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) project that aims to automate the web application's User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
User Acceptance Testing is an important phase in the software development lifecycle (equivalent to the automation development lifecycle) since it ensures that the input data 
delivers the intended result. The RPA system mentioned here automates the repetitious activity of completing UAT for web applications, hence reducing time and increasing efficiency.


Overview

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is an important step in software development. It acts as a 'go/no-go' judgment point before a solution is put into production.
During User Acceptance Testing, testers test the solution's performance by entering data and confirming the results. This has traditionally been a manual procedure, which may be
time-consuming.
