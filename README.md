Introduction

**_What is The User Acceptance Testing?_**

User Acceptance Testing is an important phase in the software development lifecycle (equivalent to the automation development lifecycle) since it ensures that the input data 
delivers the intended result. The RPA system mentioned here automates the repetitious activity of completing UAT for web applications, hence reducing time and increasing efficiency.


**_Overview_**

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is an important step in software development. It acts as a 'pass or fail' judgment point before a solution is put into production.
During User Acceptance Testing, testers test the solution's performance by entering data and confirming the results. This has traditionally been a manual procedure, which may be
time-consuming.

The aim of this project is to use RPA to automate User Acceptance Testing for online applications, with a special focus on testing the production of new entries.

**_So What Is The Purpose?_**

1. This RPA project aims to simplify the UAT process for online applications by automating repetitive testing processes.

2. Increase efficiency by reducing human intervention in UAT.

3. Ensure that the supplied data consistently produces the anticipated outcome.

4. Accurate test findings can help to speed up decision-making processes.

**_What Is The Requirements?_**

Before you install this RPA solution, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Link to the Azure-hosted web application (given above).
   
2. Installed RPA software and tools, including UiPath Studio.
   
3. Test data, including input and expected output data (given).
   
4. A proper or good Internet connection.

**_Solution_**

The aim of this project is that, the Robotic Process Automation system will automate the web application's User Acceptance Testing by:

1. Inputting test data records into web application fields automatically.

2. To test the CRUD Functionalities, data will be produced and inserted into the database, then changed and removed.

3. Ensures that the expected output data is produced.

4. Delivering precise and consistent outcomes while lowering the margin of error.

**_Testing_**

To verify that the RPA solution conducts UAT correctly, thorough testing is required.

**Testers must validate that:**

1. The RPA solution properly reads and inserts test data.
2. The intended output matches the output produced by the web application.
3. The solution gently handles any exceptions or problems.
   
**_Deployment_**

The RPA solution passed all testing and has been made available online via the Orchestrator.

**_Conclusion_**

The goal of this RPA project is to dramatically improve the efficiency of web application UAT. It also aims to test and improve the website's CRUD features. By automating repeated operations, it decreases the possibility of human mistake and speeds up decision-making. Implementing this approach will result in more consistent UAT outcomes and, eventually, a more efficient software development life cycle.
